SikuliX Java API
===

The Java implementation comprising the API to access the top elements (Screen, Region, Pattern, Match, Image, ...) 
and their methods allowing to search for images and to act on points and matches simulating mouse and keyboard.

**Notes on snapshot version 2.1.0**

**Java 11+ and 64-Bit support** are required.

It is only usable as a Maven dependency (hence Java library) in suitable Java compatible development environments.

It can not be used any longer as executable jar from commandline. 
The scripting support is completely moved to the IDE package.

The features are currently in line with stable version 2.0.5 and fix version 2.0.6 (work in progress).

**VNC and Andoid support** is currently suspended.

About the native libraries for **OpenCV and Tesseract** [look here](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX1/blob/master/IDE/README.md).
